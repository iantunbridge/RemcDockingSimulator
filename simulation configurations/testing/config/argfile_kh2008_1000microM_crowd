# molecules
# - this section inserts molecules that are counted as part of the bound complex 
# p(x,y,z) r(x,y,z,a) filename
# p(x,y,z) or t(x,y,z) p = absolute position (x,y,z); t = translate by (x,y,z). one is required
# the bounding box is defined as {x,y,z} = {[0:boundry],[0:boundry],[0:boundry]} p and r can be 
# outside the bounds but will be set equal to the modulo of it and the boundry size on the 1st MC move  
# r(x,y,z,a) = rotate about axis x,y,z by a in a clockwise manner
# filename is the path to the file, can be relative to the executable or absolute
